title: Active Dirctory Adventures part 1
---

Windows Active Directory is a database of network reasorce objects. That proliferates in modern enterprise network architectures.
This post is about going from external client to Domain Controller using some fun tools and tricks.

There is a firewall in place so we scan some likely ports with the no ping (-Pn) option and add increased speed (-T4) and version detection (-sV)


`nmap -T4 -sV -Pn -p80,443 10.7.12.0/24`

We bust the http ports for available directories and find on on 10.7.12.12/mvc, a sales site and uses a backend database to manage its merchandise information.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-site.jpg)


The url shows an aspx script that makes a call to the databse to retrieve product information.
We capture the request with Burp Suite and probe this injection point with sqlmap.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-mvc-web-req.jpg)

We can use the copy to file function and write the request to procuct.req and then sick sqlmap on it.


`sqlmap -r product.req --level=5 --risk=3`

This proves successful and we are able to dump the entire database. 
Of interest is a table giving Active Directory users fullnames and their respective groups

```
Database: ADConnect
Table: ADUsers
[40 entries]

Dirbusting the other open http/s ports we find /rdweb access ie remote dsktop web access. 
If we can derive the correct username given the full names of the AD users we can test weak passwords with the rdweb login.

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-rdweb-login.jpg)

For this one can use a tool like burp intruder:
enter "LAB/USERNAME" and "PASSWORD" into the login field and capture with burp/zap proxy:

![](https://braaaax.github.io/braaaax.github.io/images/lky-rdweb-req.jpg)

Intruder: 
*  you can use the "cluster bomb" attack
*  remove the placeholders save for the the two USERNAME fields and the the PASSWORD field
*  we are relating payloads to a given placeholder here so use the userlist you created for placeholder1 and copy that lost for paload 2 and use a password list for payload 3
*  make sure to Always Follow Redirection in the options tab

```python
import csv
with open("/root/.sqlmap/output/10.7.12.12/dump/ADConnect/ADUsers.csv") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print('{}{}'.format(row['FirstName'][0].lower(), row['LastName'].lower()))
```

Passords List:
Summer2017!
Winter2017!
Fall2017!
Spring2017!
Summer2018!

User Credentials Found:
avazquez:Spring2017!
mholliday:Summer2017!
wbaird:Autum2017!

We attempt a login with LAB\avazquez, and success!

We don't want the rdweb and its two applications, we want the full experience. So we log into Annie's account with remmina.
